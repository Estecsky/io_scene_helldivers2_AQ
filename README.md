## io_scene_helldivers2
A Blender addon facilitating the modding of textures, meshes and materials contained within Helldivers 2 archives.

### DISCLAIMER
Helldivers 2 is a multiplayer game with anti-cheat measures. While the client-side cosmetic mods that this tool is capable of producing are unlikely to trigger those measures (and has yet to do so in over 40 hours of personal testing), modding of any sort is done entirely at the risk of the end-user and neither ToastedShoes, Kboy, Irastris, GitHub, Nexus Mods, or any other entity can be held responsible for damages that may result from utilizing this tool and/or mods produced with it. **You have been warned!**

### Installation
[Download the latest release build](https://github.com/kboykboy2/io_scene_helldivers2/releases/download/latest/io_scene_helldivers2.zip) and install it into Blender 4.0. Windows is the only supported operating system at this time, and Blender 4.1 is not supported at this time due to API changes.

### Usage
We've taken the time to write a tutorial focused on armor modding which should assist those already moderately familiar with mesh modding and Blender in general. Unfortunately we do not have the means to provide constant support to anyone new to either, but in the event anyone should write a more in-depth tutorial, create a video tutorial, etc, we would be happy to feature it here if it's brought to our attention.
